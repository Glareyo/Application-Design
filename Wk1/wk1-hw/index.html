        <h3>A Break Down of Techniques, Style, and Characteristics</h3>
        <br>
        <p>For a short background, I am currently taking <b>African-American Music Survey</b> at Columbia College</p>
        <p>In the first week, <b>African Vocality</b> was introduced to the course, a breakdown of different African styles and techniques that were used to in music, from oldies to modern music</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="width-line"></div>
        <p>This website will be focusing on a song written by Wilbur Schwandt, Fabian Andre, and Gus Kahn.</p> 
        <p>This duet version is one of my favorites, sung by </p>
        <b>Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong</b>
        <p>that utilizes various African Vocality throughout the song.</p>
