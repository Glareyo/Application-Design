        <h3>A Break Down of Techniques, Style, and Characteristics</h3>
        <br>
        <p>For a short background, I am currently taking <b>African-American Music Survey</b> at Columbia College</p>
        <p>In the first week, <b>African Vocality</b> was introduced to the course, a breakdown of different African
            styles and techniques that were used to in music, from oldies to modern music</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="width-line"></div>
        <p>This website will be focusing on a song written by Wilbur Schwandt, Fabian Andre, and Gus Kahn.</p>
        <p>This duet version is one of my favorites, sung by </p>
        <b>Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong</b>
        <p>that utilizes various African Vocality throughout the song.</p>

        <h3>Musical Breakdown</h3>

        <section>
            <h4>Call and Response</h4>
            <p>Call and Response is a particular techinque where a singer, or instrument, performs a verse / melody,
                which is followed up by a reponse from another singer or instrument.</p>
            <p>In this particular song, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong demonstrates this technique from <b>1:05 to
                    1:33</b>.</p>
            <ul class="lyrical-list">
                <li>Louis - “…Stars fading, but I linger on dear…”</li>
                <li>Ella - “…Oh, how you linger on…”</li>
                <li>Louis - “…Still craving your kiss…”</li>
                <li>Ella - “…How you crave my kiss…”</li>
                <li>Louis - “…Now I’m longing to linger till dawn dear, just saying this...”</li>
                <li>Ella - “…Give me a little kiss…”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As shown, the singers utilize Call and Response, making it seem like the duet are talking to each other
                in the romantic song.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Call and Response + Vocal Rhythmization</h4>
            <p>Vocal Rhythmization is another African Vocality. In particular, Vocal Rhythmization is where a singer or singers, rather than using words, instead create vocal sounds to further a rythm, such as rapping, chanting...</p>
            <p>Or in this case, scatting...</p>
            <p>Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong continue to demonstrate Call and Response, but in combination of Vocal Rhythmization between <b>1:53 to 2:22</b>.</p>
            <ul class="lyrical-list">
                <li>Louis - (Scatting)</li>
                <li>Ella - (responds with her scats)</li>
                <li>Louis - “Fade…but I linger on dear….still craving your kiss…”</li>
                <li>Ella - (Responds with more scats)</li>
                <li>Louis - “Yeah, I’m longing to linger till dawn dear…”</li>
                <li>Ella - (Responds with more scats)</li>
                <li>Louis - “Just Saying this…(followed by a short low moan / scat )</li>
                <li>Ella - (Finishes scatting)</li>
                <li>(Louis and Ella continue singing the lyrics)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As shown, Louis begins singing the melody and lyrics, with Ella Fitzgerald following up with responses. However, Ella uses Vocal Rhythmization in the form of scatting to further add to the stylization of the song.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Guttural Effects + Bent Note</h4>
            <p>A Guttural Effect is are vocal sounds that do not represent a lyric or meaning, but rather adds onto the song using expressions, such as screams, or in this case, moans. And Bent Notes are vocal or rhythmic sounds were the note is held, but the pitch of the note increases or decreases as it is being held.</p>
            <p>Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong demonstrate these technqiues in combination as well, from <b>2:21 to 2:34</b>.</p>
            <ul class="lyrical-list">
                <li>Louis and Ella – “Sweet dreams…”</li>
                <li> Louis - “I’m dreamin…(followed by a low moan)</li>
                <li>Ella - “Till some dreams find you…”</li>
                <li>Louis - (Raises the pitch)</li>
                <li>Ella - “Keep Dreaming…”</li>
                <li>Louis - “Got to keep dreaming…(followed by another low to high moan)</li>
                <li>Ella - “Leave those worries behind you…”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As shown, Louis Armstrong uses Guttural Effects in a Call and Response fashion to Ella Fitzgerald’s singing. But to further add to this, Louis creates those Guttural Effects with a Bent Note style, continuing to use 2-3 vocal styles at the same time.</p>
